CMB2: A hitchhikerâ€™s guide to the WordPress galaxy
====

A WordCamp Wilmington demo/walk-through for using CMB2 to power your project's fields. This repo is to demonstrate how to get up and running with CMB2 and will be used for my [WordCamp Wilmington session](https://2016.wilmington.wordcamp.org/sessions/#wcorg-session-462). Slides [are available here](http://dsgnwrks.pro/custom-meta-and-settings-with-cmb2/#begin).

To follow demonstration, [check out the tags](https://github.com/jtsternberg/CMB2-WPSessions-Demo/releases) in order.
